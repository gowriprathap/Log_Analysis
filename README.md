 2. Download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
 3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/gowriprathap/Log_Analysis.git` in your terminal.
 5. Download [the newsdata database](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip) into the vagrant folder.
 6. cd into the vagrant folder using your bash interface.
 7. Launch the virtual machine with `vagrant up` using git bash.
 8. This may take a long time depending on the speed of your internet. After the necessary files have been downloaded and installed, use `vagrant ssh` to log in with your SSH.
 9. The command line will now start with vagrant in a linux environment.
 10. cd into the /vagrant folder.
